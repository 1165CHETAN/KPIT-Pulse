## Why Quantum Computing?


#### Chemical Simulation:

Quantum computing improves accuracy in simulating complex molecular structures.
Methods like DFT, HF, and Post-Hartree-Fock offer varying levels of accuracy and computational cost.

#### Optimization in Route Planning:

Quantum computing transforms logistics by reducing costs through global routing optimization.
QAOA and Quantum Annealing provide approximate solutions for optimization problems.

#### Machine Learning and AI:

Quantum computing may contribute to next-gen AI, potentially enabling AGI.
Debate exists on the commercial usefulness of quantum computing for AI applications.
## Stats about Quantum Computing:

In a quantum arms race, IBM's recent unveiling of a 127-qubit processor and QuEra's announcement of a formidable 256-qubit machine have propelled quantum computing into uncharted territory. This quantum leap far exceeds the capabilities of previous processors, which were capped at 100 qubits. The competitive surge marks a pivotal moment in the race to develop powerful quantum computers, with each breakthrough pushing the boundaries of quantum computing capabilities.

The quantum landscape's dynamism is underscored by industry players' active participation. Microsoft and Amazon are already offering quantum computing services through {% mark %}Azure Quantum and Braket{% /mark %}, while Google sets an ambitious goal of creating a 1 million qubit computer by 2029. This flurry of activity and announcements reflects a broader trend, indicating a robust push for advancements in quantum computing.

Beyond the competition, the {% mark %}quantum computing{% /mark %} market is poised for remarkable growth. Data from the Statista Digital Economy Compass projects that the global quantum computing market could reach $9 billion in revenue by 2030, a significant surge from $260 million in 2020. This anticipated growth, averaging over 40 percent annually between 2020 and 2030, foretells a transformative decade with the potential for groundbreaking technological advancements, driven by the extraordinary computing capabilities of quantum systems that can simultaneously represent both 1 and 0 states in a single qubit.
