>Astro is an all-in-one web framework for {% mark %}building fast{% /mark %}, content-focused websites. Why choose Astro over another web framework? Here are five core design principles to help explain why we built Astro, the problems that it exists to solve, and why Astro may be the best choice for your project or team.

## Why to go with Astro?

Astro is…
- Content-focused: Astro was designed for content-rich websites.
- Server-first: Websites run faster when they render HTML on the server.
- Fast by default: It should be impossible to build a slow website in Astro.
- Easy to use: You don’t need to be an expert to build something with Astro.
- Fully-featured, but flexible: Over 100+ Astro integrations to choose from.

In a quantum arms race, IBM's recent unveiling of a 127-qubit processor and QuEra's announcement of a formidable 256-qubit machine have propelled quantum computing into uncharted territory. This quantum leap far exceeds the capabilities of previous processors, which were capped at 100 qubits. The competitive surge marks a pivotal moment in the race to develop powerful quantum computers, with each breakthrough pushing the boundaries of quantum computing capabilities.

The quantum landscape's dynamism is underscored by industry players' active participation. Microsoft and Amazon are already offering quantum computing services through {% mark %}Azure Quantum and Braket{% /mark %}, while Google sets an ambitious goal of creating a 1 million qubit computer by 2029. This flurry of activity and announcements reflects a broader trend, indicating a robust push for advancements in quantum computing.

Beyond the competition, the {% mark %}quantum computing{% /mark %} market is poised for remarkable growth. Data from the Statista Digital Economy Compass projects that the global quantum computing market could reach $9 billion in revenue by 2030, a significant surge from $260 million in 2020. This anticipated growth, averaging over 40 percent annually between 2020 and 2030, foretells a transformative decade with the potential for groundbreaking technological advancements, driven by the extraordinary computing capabilities of quantum systems that can simultaneously represent both 1 and 0 states in a single qubit.
