>Netlify is a powerful platform that simplifies web development with seamless Git-based workflows, global CDN deployment, serverless functions, and built-in CI/CD for efficient and scalable web projects.

## Why to go with Netlify

Easy Deployment: Netlify simplifies the deployment process by offering seamless integration with popular version control systems like Git. Continuous Deployment is automated, making it easy to publish updates with each code push.

Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): Netlify utilizes a global CDN to distribute content across multiple servers worldwide. This results in faster loading times for websites and applications, providing a better user experience regardless of the user's geographical location.

Serverless Functions: Netlify supports serverless architecture, allowing developers to build and deploy serverless functions effortlessly. This facilitates the creation of dynamic, scalable web applications without managing traditional server infrastructure.

Built-in CI/CD: Netlify provides built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities. Automated builds ensure that the latest changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving overall code quality.

Scalability and Performance Monitoring: Netlify offers scalability as projects grow, and it provides performance monitoring tools to help developers identify and address bottlenecks. This ensures that websites and applications hosted on Netlify can handle increased traffic and maintain optimal performance.
