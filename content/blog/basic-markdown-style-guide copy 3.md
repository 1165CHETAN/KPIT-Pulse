## What is Typescript?
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing to the dynamic typing of JavaScript, making it easier to catch and prevent errors during development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use the latest ECMAScript features and providing enhanced tooling support for a more robust and scalable coding experience.

## Why to choose Typescript over Javascript?
1. Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to catch errors during development rather than runtime, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

2. Enhanced Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript provides better tooling support and richer Integrated Development Environment (IDE) features, enabling autocompletion, refactoring, and improved navigation for a more productive development experience.

3. Code Readability and Maintainability: With the inclusion of static types, TypeScript code tends to be more self-documenting, making it easier to understand and maintain over time. This contributes to better collaboration among developers and reduces the likelihood of certain types of bugs.

4. ES6+ Features with Strong Compatibility: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it supports all JavaScript features while extending it with additional functionality, especially from ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later. Developers can gradually adopt TypeScript in existing JavaScript projects without major disruptions.

5.Better Scalability and Maintainability: As projects grow in size and complexity, TypeScript's static typing and advanced tooling become increasingly valuable. They help prevent common pitfalls and errors, making the codebase more scalable, maintainable, and conducive to long-term development.
